# Specification Quality Checklist: KIND Local Development Environment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- User decisions incorporated:
  - Mount simulation: Local filesystem paths (no WebDAV required)
  - CI integration: Local development only (not added to GitHub Actions)
- All 4 user stories are independently testable and prioritized
- 11 functional requirements cover cluster setup, deployment, simulation, and automation
- 7 success criteria provide measurable validation targets
